## To run:

## Description

A technological play on the classic word guess game, Hangman. DrenchBot challenges you to guess a tech-themed word letter-by-letter with only ten guesses! Better think hard or the world's first super AI will be shorting out under water.

## Motivation
To practice with JavaScript. At this point in time, I had not yet learned JQuery. However, I was still able to create dynamic HTML using if..else statements with document.onkeyup!

## Results
Currently, a working version of the app is complete.

## Work Load
DrenchBot is a solo project completed entirely by me.

## Challenges
The dynamic HTML was probably the trickiest part. I ended up making the water fill by having the <div>s already in place, and just setting the background image of each one as wrong letters were guessed.

## Improvements
 I think that the autoplay for the music could be eliminated.

## Technologies used:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
